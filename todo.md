Requirements:
[] Feature a button that selects a random recipe, and your page should display the selected item
[] Have an empty state, e.g. if there are no recipes matching the filter - show a meaningful message to the user


If time allows:
[] change if else to switch?
[] show more info in the recipes cards:
  [] diets
  [] polularity
  [] price per serving
[] add "all" buttons to filters
[] hide filtering/sorting options when not active OR create dropdowns for each filter/sorting
[] check input attributes (change value="Over 60 min" to kebab-case?)
