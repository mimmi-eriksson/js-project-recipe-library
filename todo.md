Focus on / requirements:
[X] Implement local storage caching to reduce API requests
[X] fix bug with double recipes showing when applying to multiple filters


Strech goals (pick at least one below):
[X] Implement a feature so that the user will be able to see the instructions/steps, for example when clicking a button.
[] Allow users to search for specific recipe names or ingredients
[] Allow users to save/like recipes and store them in local storage. This includes adding a heart button to the recipe card and adding a "View favourites" button that only shows favourite recipes.
[] Implement pagination for large results or infinite scrolling (e.g. fetching more recipes when the user has reached the bottom)


If time allows:
[] show filtering/sorting options when active
